# What's Next?
You have now completed this tutorial, give yourself a pat on the back! Here are some things that you can do now:

If you are looking for a playground to explore the language yourself, navigate to the next section. Alternatively, if you are familiar with the command line, build and use the command-line interpreter - its got more features.

If you are interested in further learning of the Devia language, take a look at the standard library and some special functions in the interpreter source code.

If you want to learn and try more of Javascript, pressing F12 on a website will bring up a well-made IDE for it.

If you want more challenges or even projects, here are some:

### Challenges
1. [The Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is a beautiful image from mathematics. Make a program in Devia that draws the set - use `.` and ` ` to represent fill and empty coordinates.
2. An online game revolves around finding English words by a substring. Write a program to cheat this process by letting the computer do it.
3. This website is created using Devia in browser. Try this yourselves and make some interesting websites!

Finally, any feedbacks for me?
